	abstract = {W present the results of our work testing a version of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) used by Hamuy et al. and Dessart \& Hillier to calculate distances to Type II-P supernovae, accounting for the deviations of their luminosities from those of true blackbodies. This method was applied to a sample of supernovae with data sets covering different postexplosion time periods. Different spectral lines in visible wavelengths-Hβ, He I, Fe II, Sc II, Na I, and Ba II-are used to measure the expansion velocity with the goal of determining the species that produces the most reliable distance determination when combined with the blackbody temperature of the effective photosphere. This research suggests that Hβ, Fe II, and Ba II lines are most likely to yield accurate distances when combined with blackbody temperature, and provides further evidence of EPM's effectiveness as an indicator of distance, provided we have a minimum of three data sets covering a broad range of postexplosion phases of the supernova.},

	abstract = {Radio positions of the three sources have been determined with the two 90-foot antennas working as an interferometer with an r.m.s. accuracy in both co-ordinates better than 10 seconds of arc. Direct photographs show that a starlike object exists within the error rectangle at each of the source positions. Exceedingly faint wisps of nebulosity are associated with the stars in 3C 48 and 3C 196. The observations are incomplete for 3C 286 in this regard. Photoelectric photometry of the stars shows each to have quite peculiar color indices, most closely resembling the colors of old novae or possibly white dwarfs, but we are not suggesting identification with these types of stars. Photometry of 3C 48 through 13 months shows the star to be variable by at least AV = 0W4. The radio flux appears to be constant. Optical spectra for 3C 48 show several very broad emission features, the most intense at X 3832 being unidentified. Spectra by Schmidt of 3C 196 and 3C 286 show other unusual features. The radio structure of the three radio stars is similar in that each has an unresolved core of {\textless}1" diameter. However, 3C 196 and 3C 286 show halos of 12" and 20", respectively, while no radio halo has been detected for 3C 48. it is shown that the radiant flux in the optical region can be computed from the radio-flux data and the theory of synchrotron radiation for 3C 48 and 3C 196, but not for 3C 286. This, together with other arguments, suggests that the optical as well as the radio flux could be due to the synchrotron mechanism, but the arguments are not conclusive. We have used the assumption of minimum total energy to compute the energy in relativistic particles and magnetic field required by the synchrotron mechanism to explain the observed emission. The magnetic field in each of the core components is near 0.1 gauss and depends mainly on the assumed angular size of the emitting region. The total energy in the core components is near 10 ergs. The rate of radiation is such that the energy in relativistic electrons must be replaced in a time scale of a few years if the value of the magnetic field determined in this way is correct. These calculations are based on a distance of 100pcs. The frequency of occurrence of radio stars is examined, and they are estimated to comprise from 5 to 10 per cent of sources in the 3C catalogue. The percentage is likely to be less for fainter sources. Rough limits have been estimated for the mean distances of these radio stars. A mean distance of approximately 100 pc is suggested if these objects are in the Galaxy. Evidence obtained since this paper was written suggests that 3C 48 has a large redshift of z = 0.3675 (Greenstein and Matthews 1963); thus these objects may be associated with a distant galaxy. The absolute magnitude of the starlike objects is M = -24.3, which is much brighter than any other known galaxy. As a radio source, 3C 48 is not very different from other identified sources. The emitted flux is the same as 3C 295 and Cygnus A, but the emitting volume is much less. The faint nebulosity does not resemble a galaxy, and it also is brighter than a normal galaxy. if caused by an explosion in the past and expanding at the velocity of light, its age would be {\textgreater} 1.8 X 10 years. The synchrotron lifetime calculated in the normal manner is much shorter than that inferred from the extent of the faint nebulosity. Thus either the magnetic field must be much lower than calculated, or high-energy electrons must be supplied continuously.},

The early-phase multiband light curves (LCs) exhibit the adiabatic cooling envelope emission following the shock breakout up to ∼ 14 days from the explosion. SN 2018hna has a rise time of ∼ 88 days in the V band, similar to SN 1987A. A 56Ni mass of ∼0.087 ± 0.004 M ⊙ is inferred for SN 2018hna from its bolometric LC. Hydrodynamical modeling of the cooling phase suggests a progenitor with a radius ∼50 R ⊙, a mass of ∼14-20 M ⊙, and an explosion energy of ∼1.7-2.9 × 1051 erg. The smaller inferred radius of the progenitor than a standard red supergiant is indicative of a blue supergiant progenitor of SN 2018hna. A subsolar metallicity (∼0.3 Z ⊙) is inferred for the host galaxy UGC 07534, concurrent with the low-metallicity environments of 1987A-like events.},

	abstract = {We present 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative-transfer simulations for supernovae (SNe) of Type IIb, Ib, and Ic that result from the terminal explosion of the mass donor in a close-binary system. Here, we select three ejecta with a total kinetic energy of ≈1.2 × 1051 erg, but characterized by different ejecta masses (2-5 M⊙), composition, and chemical mixing. The Type IIb/Ib models correspond to the progenitors that have retained their He-rich shell at the time of explosion. The Type Ic model arises from a progenitor that has lost its helium shell, but retains 0.32 M⊙ of helium in a CO-rich core of 5.11 M⊙. We discuss their photometric and spectroscopic properties during the first 2-3 months after explosion, and connect these to their progenitor and ejecta properties including chemical stratification. For these three models, Arnett's rule overestimates the 56Ni mass by ≈ 50 per cent while the procedure of Katz et al., based on an energy argument, yields a more reliable estimate. The presence of strong C I lines around 9000Å prior to maximum is an indicator that the pre-SN star was underabundant in helium. As noted by others, the 1.08μm feature is a complex blend of C I, Mg II, and He I lines, which makes the identification of He uncertain in SNe Ibc unless other He I lines can be identified. Our models show little scatter in (V - R) colour 10 d after R-band maximum. We also address a number of radiative transfer properties of SNe Ibc, including the notion of a photosphere, the inference of a representative ejecta expansion rate, spectrum formation, blackbody fits and `correction factors'.},

	abstract = {We present optical and IR spectroscopy of the first two months of evolution of the Type II SN 1999em. We combine these data with high-quality optical/IR photometry beginning only three days after shock breakout, in order to study the performance of the ``Expanding Photosphere Method'' (EPM) in the determination of distances. With this purpose we develop a technique to measure accurate photospheric velocities by cross-correlating observed and model spectra. The application of this technique to SN 1999em shows that we can reach an average uncertainty of 11\% in velocity from an individual spectrum. Our analysis shows that EPM is quite robust to the effects of dust. In particular, the distances derived from the VI filters change by only 7\% when the adopted visual extinction in the host galaxy is varied by 0.45 mag. The superb time sampling of the BVIZJHK light-curves of SN 1999em permits us to study the internal consistency of EPM and test the dilution factors computed from atmosphere models for Type II plateau supernovae. We find that, in the first week since explosion, the EPM distances are up to 50\% lower than the average, possibly due the presence of circumstellar material. Over the following 65 days, on the other hand, our tests lend strong credence to the atmosphere models, and confirm previous claims that EPM can produce consistent distances without having to craft specific models to each supernova. This is particularly true for the VI filters which yield distances with an internal consistency of 4\%. From the whole set of BVIZJHK photometry, we obtain an average distance of 7.5+/-0.5 Mpc, where the quoted uncertainty (7\%) is a conservative estimate of the internal precision of the method obtained from the analysis of the first 70 days of the supernova evolution.

	abstract = {The Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) determines distances to Type II supernova (SNe II) by comparing the photospheric angular size with the expansion velocity measured from spectral lines. The photospheres of SNe II are low density and are dominated by electron scattering, and consequently the photospheric flux is dilute relative to a Planck function at the best-fitting continuum color temperature. The reliability of EPM distances depends on understanding bow the dilution is related to physical properties of the supernova atmosphere. To study this, we have calculated 63 different model atmospheres relevant to SNe II. The excitation, ionization, and thermal structure are described for the case of high effective temperature in which the atmosphere is completely ionized, and for the case of cooler effective temperatures in which the photosphere is formed in a region of recombining hydrogen. The general spectral features of both cases are discussed. We explore how the computed spectrum changes with density structure, helium abundance, metallicity, expansion rate, and luminosity or effective temperature. The most important variable in determining spectral appearance is the effective temperature. The amount by which the emergent flux is dilute relative to the best-fitting blackbody depends on a number of factors, most important of which are the temperature and, in short-wavelength bandpasses, density at the photosphere. For each of the models we derive distance correction factors for application in EPM, using the four filter combinations \{BV\}, \{VI\_c\_\}, \{BVI\_c\_\}, and \{JHK\}. The main differences may be expressed in terms of the observable color temperature and a slowly varying dependence on density. Functional fits to the distance correction factor are provided which can be used to estimate the photospheric angular size from broadband photometry. The effect of uncertain dust extinction on angular size is shown to be small. This work places EPM on a firm theoretical foundation and substantiates the Hubble constant measurement by Schmidt et al. of H\_0\_ = 73 +/- 7.},
