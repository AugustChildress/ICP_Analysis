To start off, we have to talk about what becomes of a star during a Type - IIp supernova.
When the star explodes, an envelope of gas expands in all directions at a high rate of speed.
The speed of the expanding gas can be determined by looking at the spectrum of the light being 
emitted by the gas and comparing it to another source to see how blueshifted it is. This is done 
using spectroscopy. 
\\
For the Expanding Photosphere Method to work, we have to assume that the expanding photosphere of gas 
is thin and uniform, meaning that it expands evenly in all directions away from the star.
\\
The equation we will use to determine the distance is called the angular radius.

In the above figure there is a disk, a person, and a right triangle between them.
Lets assume for the sake of explination that the disk is the Sun and the person is on Earth.
The distance between the person and the Sun is $d$ and the radius of the Sun is $R$.
The angle $\theta$ created by the right triangle formed is called the angular radius.
