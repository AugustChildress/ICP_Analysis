This analysis combined data collected from multiple photmetric and spectroscopic observations and tecniques 
from decades of scientific papers to create code that estimates the distance to the SN1987a-like supernova, 
SN2018hna. The analysis concludes that the derived distance, between ~13-15 Mpcs, is within acceptable range 
of other estimates and confirms the accuracy of the data and method.
