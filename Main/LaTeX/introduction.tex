The distance between us and the stars above was a mystery to ancient 
astronomers. Not knowing the true unfathomable distance, they assumed
the stars were just points of light in a cosmic dome that surrounded
and rotated around the earth, the "center of the universe". It took 
centuries of free thinkers to finally accept that we arent the center 
of the universe, and that stars are in fact just like our own sun, just 
very far away. It took longer still to determine distances to those stars.
In the 1600s, several methods were developed by a few great astronomers 
whose names are remembered today.
