The distance between us and the stars above was a mystery to ancient 
astronomers. Not knowing the true unfathomable distance, they assumed
the stars were just points of light in a cosmic dome that surrounded
and rotated around the earth, the "center of the universe". It took 
centuries of free thinkers to finally accept that we arent the center 
of the universe, and that stars are in fact just like our own sun, just 
very far away. It took longer still to determine how far away those stars
actually were. Today, we have developed many techniques to solve this very 
problem. The techniqe I will be using in this paper to determine the distance
to a supernova is called the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM). It involves the 
expanding envelope of gas around the supernova, a calculated speed of the
expansion, the temperature of the gas, and various spectral and photometric data.
