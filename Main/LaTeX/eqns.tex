\begin{equation}
    \sin{\theta} = \frac{R}{d}
\end{equation}
If $\theta$ is significantly smaller than 1, then $\sin{\theta} = \theta$
\begin{equation}
    \theta = \frac{R}{d}
\end{equation}
The radius is changing because of the expanding photosphere. We can calulate the velocity and starting point of expansion so $R = v(t-t_0)$.\\
Since the distance is many million lightyears, we have to account for time dialation. This is
